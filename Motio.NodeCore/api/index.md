# **API DOCUMENTATION**
Welcome to the API Documentation for Water Motion! Here you will find all the details for each class you have access to.

You might need some knowledge before understanding some part of this, be sure to check out the [Introduction Article](/doc/articles/intro.html) to catch up!

All the documentation is in C# but using it in Python as simple as importing the namespace as if it was a Python module.
We prepared some examples for you to learn from [here](/doc/examples)
