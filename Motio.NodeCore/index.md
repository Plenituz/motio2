# [**DOWNLOAD WATER MOTION DEVELOPER PREVIEW**](/latestBuild)
Do it, [it's right here](/latestBuild)

You just have to unzip it in any folder and launch **Motio2.exe**

## Why Developer Preview?
We know that a great part of the motion designer community is used to creating their own tools.
That's why we built Water Motion to be really easy to extend. Creating your own node is as simple as copy pasting a C#/Python file in the right directory.

We choosed to release a developer preview for tinkerers to play around with. You can view it as a pre-pre-alpha where the framework of the software is in place
but the content is not fully done yet. To start tinkering head to the [Articles](/doc/articles/intro.html) or [Documentation](/doc/api) section

## What if I am not a developer?
If you are not a developer and just want to try out the software read the first [article here](/doc/articles/intro.html). It will provide you with enough knowledge
to play around. Please note that you won't be able to create real animations yet, but it will give you an overview of what is Water Motion and where it's headed.

## Work in progress
The documentation and examples are still a work in progress.
